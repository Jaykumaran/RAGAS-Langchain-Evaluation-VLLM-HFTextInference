What is retrieval-augmented text generation and how does it differ from conventional text generation models?,"Answer: Retrieval-augmented text generation is a technique in computational linguistics that combines text generation with retrieval of existing text. It differs from conventional text generation models in that it uses previously generated text as a source of information to improve the quality and accuracy of the generated text. This approach has been shown to have remarkable advantages, particularly in achieving state-of-the-art performance in various NLP tasks such as dialogue response generation and machine translation. The generic paradigm of retrieval-augmented generation involves retrieval metrics, sources, and integration paradigms. This technique has attracted increasing attention in the computational linguistics community, and recent methods are being explored to facilitate future research in this area.","['Abstract\nRecently, retrieval-augmented text generation\nattracted increasing attention of the compu-\ntational linguistics community.\nCompared\nwith conventional generation models, retrieval-\naugmented text generation has remarkable ad-'

Unlike conventional text generation models that generate new text from scratch, retrieval-augmented text generation uses a retrieval component to first identify relevant information from a large corpus, and then incorporates it into the generated text. This approach has several advantages, such as improved accuracy, reduced redundancy, and better coherence. In dialogue response generation, for example, retrieval-augmented text generation can provide more accurate and relevant responses by incorporating information from previous dialogues or related documents. In machine translation, it can improve the quality of translations by incorporating information from the source language text.
