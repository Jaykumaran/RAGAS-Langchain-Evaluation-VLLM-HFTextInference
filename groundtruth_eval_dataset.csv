(2018), which combines a retrieval component and a generation component, and the Retrieval-augmented Generative Response (RaGR) model by Zhang et al. (2019), which uses a retrieval-augmented decoding algorithm. For machine translation, the authors mention the Retrieval-based Machine Translation (RMT) model by Gu et al. (2018), which uses a retrieval component to select relevant source sentences for translation, and the Retrieval-augmented Neural Machine Translation (RaNMT) model by Zhang et al. (2019), which uses a retrieval-augmented decoding algorithm. The authors also highlight other notable approaches for tasks such as question answering, summarization, and text style transfer."

Unlike conventional text generation models that generate new text from scratch, retrieval-augmented text generation uses a retrieval component to first identify relevant information from a large corpus, and then incorporates it into the generated text. This approach has several advantages, such as improved accuracy, reduced redundancy, and better coherence. In dialogue response generation, for example, retrieval-augmented text generation can provide more accurate and relevant responses by incorporating information from previous dialogues or related documents. In machine translation, it can improve the quality of translations by incorporating information from the source language text. Overall, retrieval-augmented text generation shows remarkable performance in many NLP tasks and has attracted increasing attention from the computational linguistics community."

Abstract

Unlike conventional generation models that generate text from scratch, retrieval-augmented generation models first retrieve relevant information from a large corpus and then generate text based on that information. This approach has several advantages over conventional generation models. Firstly, it allows the generation of more accurate and diverse responses, as the model can draw from a wider range of sources. Secondly, it reduces the computational cost of text generation, as the model can reuse existing text instead of generating it from scratch. Thirdly, it improves the model's ability to handle long-range dependencies, as it can retrieve relevant information from distant parts of the corpus. Overall, retrieval-augmented text generation has achieved state-of-the-art performance in many NLP tasks, including dialogue response generation, machine translation, and other generation tasks."

Unlike conventional generation models that generate text from scratch, retrieval-augmented generation uses a retrieval component to first identify relevant information from a large corpus, and then combines it with newly generated text to produce more accurate and coherent responses. This approach has several advantages over conventional generation models. Firstly, it allows the model to leverage the vast amount of existing knowledge and information in the corpus, which can significantly improve the quality and accuracy of the generated text. Secondly, it can reduce the computational complexity of the generation process, as the model does not have to generate every word from scratch, but can instead reuse existing text. Thirdly, it can improve the coherence and relevance of the generated text, as it can incorporate information from multiple sources and perspectives. Overall, retrieval-augmented text generation has shown remarkable advantages and has achieved state-of-the-art performance in many NLP tasks, making it a promising direction for future research in the field."

Recently, this technique has achieved state-of-the-art performance in many NLP tasks. The generic paradigm of retrieval-augmented generation involves combining the output of a generation model with relevant information retrieved from a large corpus. This approach has several advantages. Firstly, it allows the model to leverage the knowledge and context from a large corpus, which can improve the quality and relevance of the generated text. Secondly, it can reduce the computational cost of generating new text from scratch, as the model can reuse existing text instead. Thirdly, it can improve the robustness and flexibility of the model, as it can adapt to new contexts and tasks by retrieving relevant information from the corpus. Overall, retrieval-augmented text generation is a promising direction for NLP research, with many notable approaches already developed for tasks such as dialogue response generation, machine translation, and other generation tasks."

Unlike conventional generation models, which generate text from scratch based solely on input context, retrieval-augmented text generation utilizes a combination of generation and retrieval techniques.  The basic idea is to first retrieve relevant information from a large corpus, and then generate new text by incorporating and expanding upon this information.  This approach has several advantages that have contributed to its increasing popularity in NLP tasks. Firstly, it allows for more accurate and diverse text generation, as the model can draw from a wider range of sources and incorporate more contextually relevant information. Secondly, it can significantly reduce the computational complexity of text generation, as the model can reuse existing text instead of generating everything from scratch. Thirdly, it can improve the coherence and cohesion of generated text, as it can better capture the structure and semantics of the underlying corpus. Overall, retrieval-augmented text generation represents a promising direction for NLP research, with the potential to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and naturalness of text generation in a variety of applications."
