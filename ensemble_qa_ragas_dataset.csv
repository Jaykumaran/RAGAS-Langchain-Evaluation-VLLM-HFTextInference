What is retrieval-augmented text generation and how does it differ from conventional text generation models?,"Answer: Retrieval-augmented text generation is a paradigm in natural language processing that combines traditional text generation methods with retrieval techniques. It differs from conventional text generation models in that it incorporates information from existing texts, or a retrieval source, to enhance the generated output. This approach has shown remarkable advantages, particularly in achieving state-of-the-art performance in various NLP tasks such as dialogue response generation and machine translation. The retrieval source, integration paradigm, and retrieval metrics are three major components of retrieval-augmented text generation that will be discussed in this survey.","['attracted increasing attention of the compu-\ntational linguistics community.\nCompared\nwith conventional generation models, retrieval-\naugmented text generation has remarkable ad-\nvantages and particularly has achieved state-of-\nthe-art performance in many NLP tasks.

This approach has several advantages, such as improved accuracy, reduced redundancy, and better coherence.
